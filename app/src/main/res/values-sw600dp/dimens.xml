        ~ Important: keep the 2/5 & 3/5 ratios between width & weight.
        ~ The sum of these dimensions should be equal to 840dp.
        ~ Why 840? Because Google says so here: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/support-different-screen-sizes
        ~ The name of the `values-sw600dp-w840dp` folder should be 840 too.
        ~ If we ever want to change this 840 value, we need to change it in both places.
