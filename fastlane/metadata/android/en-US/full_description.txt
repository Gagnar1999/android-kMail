Send and receive emails from your Infomaniak email addresses.
Set kMail as your default email application.
Search for a specific message or your unread emails, favorites or attachments.
Switch from one account to another to access all your email addresses managed at Infomaniak.
Be notified immediately of the arrival of new emails (push).
Organize your emails in personalized folders.
Scan to move, archive and delete emails quickly.
Customize your experience (dark/light theme, accent color, display density, scanning actions in the inbox, etc.).
Protect access to the kMail app (depending on how you lock your device).
